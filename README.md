### What I learned

I did this challenge as part of Frontend Mentor's learning path on ["Advanced CSS Techniques"](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/advanced-css-techniques-vdOtKjIC4V). The [previous lesson](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/advanced-css-techniques-vdOtKjIC4V/steps/6747d0a9d54b5cb1dee3f393/article/read) was about utilizing CSS methodologies and architectures to develop cleaner, more modular, and more maintainable code. So I chose to do this challenge using [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/), which stands for: Composition Utility Block Exception Cascading Style Sheets. In the past, I had relied much more on the [BEM methodology](https://getbem.com/), but I have been utilizing Andy Bell's thinking in my [layouts](https://every-layout.dev/) and [general thinking about CSS](https://youtu.be/5uhIiI9Ld5M?si=TQZ4hIFsR29yVADz), and so felt it was a great opportunity to fully try on CUBE CSS in a relatively easy challenge.

Overall, I thought it was a great experience, and plan to keep using it and learning more about it and how to implement it well.

- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) - the authoritative source.
- [Build a dashboard with CUBE CSS](https://piccalil.li/blog/build-a-dashboard-with-cube-css/) - This is a great resource, as Andy Bell himself walks through applying CUBE CSS to building a simple dashboard.
- [A look at the CUBE CSS methodology in action](https://youtu.be/NanhQvnvbR8?si=ZWVagIwuQARzseYT) - I relied a lot on this vide. Kevin Powell always does a great job walking through stuff, and this video was no exception.
- [A (more) Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/)
- [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/)
- [CSS Popover + Anchor Positioning is Magical](https://youtu.be/DNXEORSk4GU?si=-Dy4b6U1794WVhlO) - I used this to implement the transition of the image hover.

### Continued development

More general ideas I want to consider:

### Useful resources

- [Accessibility Developer Guide](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/)
- [MDN Web Docs for CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Went here a lot to reference the different CSS properties and the shorthands, and all the great explanations about best practices.
- [The Clamp Calculator](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/) - Used for all of fluid typography and fluid spacing calculations.
