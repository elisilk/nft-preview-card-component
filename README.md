### What I learned

I did this challenge as part of Frontend Mentor's learning path on ["Advanced CSS Techniques"](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/advanced-css-techniques-vdOtKjIC4V). The [previous lesson](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/advanced-css-techniques-vdOtKjIC4V/steps/6747d0a9d54b5cb1dee3f393/article/read) was about utilizing CSS methodologies and architectures to develop cleaner, more modular, and more maintainable code. So I chose to do this challenge using [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/), which stands for: Composition Utility Block Exception Cascading Style Sheets. In the past, I had relied much more on the [BEM methodology](https://getbem.com/), but I have been utilizing Andy Bell's thinking in my [layouts](https://every-layout.dev/) and [general thinking about CSS](https://youtu.be/5uhIiI9Ld5M?si=TQZ4hIFsR29yVADz), and so felt it was a great opportunity to fully try on CUBE CSS in a relatively easy challenge.

Overall, I thought it was a great experience, and plan to keep using it and learning more about it and how to implement it well.

- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) - the authoritative source.
- [Build a dashboard with CUBE CSS](https://piccalil.li/blog/build-a-dashboard-with-cube-css/) - This is a great resource, as Andy Bell himself walks through applying CUBE CSS to building a simple dashboard.
- [A look at the CUBE CSS methodology in action](https://youtu.be/NanhQvnvbR8?si=ZWVagIwuQARzseYT) - I relied a lot on this vide. Kevin Powell always does a great job walking through stuff, and this video was no exception.
- [A (more) Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/)
- [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/)
- [CSS Popover + Anchor Positioning is Magical](https://youtu.be/DNXEORSk4GU?si=-Dy4b6U1794WVhlO) - I used this to implement the transition of the image hover.

### Continued development

Specific areas that the solution should be improved (known issues):

- I'm not sure that I have the flow spacing perfectly set up. There might be some differentation between the block spacing between different elements within the card and the spacing could possibly change from the mobile to the desktop version. But I don't understand an easy way to get those spacing values out of Figma (without doing a whole bunch of annoying manual calculations), and I felt like this first approximation looks pretty good. If I have time, I will go back and make those adjustments.

More general ideas I want to consider:

Hmm 🤔 ...

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - He's the best.
- [Accessibility Developer Guide](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/)
- [MDN Web Docs for CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Went here a lot to reference the different CSS properties and the shorthands, and all the great explanations about best practices.
- [The Clamp Calculator](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/) - Used for all of fluid typography and fluid spacing calculations.
